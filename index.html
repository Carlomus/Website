        <h2>Welcome to My Website</h2>
        <p>
          Hi, I’m Carlo, a Machine Learning Research Scientist currently working
          at Fractile, where I’m pushing the boundaries of LLM optimization on
          next-gen chips. Our goal is ambitious—a 100x boost in both speed and
          energy efficiency for large-scale model deployment. As one of
          Fractile’s earliest hires, I’ve worn many hats, from designing
          low-level circuits to leading compiler optimizations and shaping the
          high-level architecture of our software stack.
        </p>
        <p>
          In a previous life, before ML, I was a physicist. I earned my Ph.D. in
          Particle and Accelerator Physics from the University of Oxford,
          working mainly at CERN, where I designed a low-energy beamline for the
          NA61/SHINE experiment. This project required a blend of simulation,
          data analysis, and collaboration, skills I now apply to my work in AI.
          Alongside research, I also enjoy mentoring.
        </p>
        <p>
          My interests bridge generative AI, cross-modal AI models, quantization
          and exotic number formats for efficient model deployment. But let's be
          honest, as long as there are hard problems to solve, anything can be
          interesting!
        </p>
        <p>
          On this site, you’ll find insights into my projects, research, and
          career path. Dive in to explore!
        </p>
        <p>
          When I'm not working I'm usually playing chess (aiming for 2000, only
          100 points to go!), bouldering, or cooking. In the winter I enjoy
          skiing, and in the summer I love scuba diving!.

        <h2>Research</h2>
        Working at an incredibly fast moving start up, it is hard to find a moment to breathe, let alone publish articles, but here are some of the projects I am currently working on:
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Optimization of Large Language Models (LLMs):</strong> Developing methods to enhance the performance of LLMs, including quantization, sparsity, exotic number formats, and generative AI optimizations tailored to next-gen hardware.</li>
              <li><strong>Efficient Model Deployment:</strong> Designing scalable and efficient deployment frameworks for AI models, focusing on reducing energy consumption and computational overhead, while maintaining performance in diverse applications.</li>
              <li><strong>Predictive Maintenance with AI:</strong> Leveraging GNNs and other AI models to anticipate and prevent hardware failures in particle accelerators, contributing to improved uptime and reliability in high-energy physics experiments.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
