        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          With a passion for innovation and a background in high-energy physics
          and machine learning, I bring a unique interdisciplinary approach to
          solving complex problems. I completed my PhD in Particle and
          Accelerator Physics from the University of Oxford in collaboration
          with CERN, focusing on experimental design and computational
          simulations for particle physics. My research at Fractile, where I
          currently work as an ML Research Scientist, involves developing
          efficient tools and optimization techniques for large-scale AI models,
          making AI solutions faster, more accurate, and hardware-compatible.
